                          ===========================

1. Open the Terminal app (you can press Cmd+Space and type "Terminal", or you
   can open it from the Applications folder in the Finder).

2. Drag the "filedetails" file from this folder into the Terminal.

3. Navigate to the folder you want to get the details of. At the top of the
   Finder window, it should show a tiny blue folder icon along with the name
   of the folder. Click on that blue folder icon and drag it into the Terminal.

4. Press Enter. It should say "Saved file details to /Users/<user>/Desktop/
   filedetails-<folder name>.csv".

5. You can close the Terminal window now.

6. The file containing the folder information will be on the desktop. You can
   open it in Excel or Google Sheets and print it from there.

In case you need the code for this program for some reason (eg. to verify that
it isn't a virus), you can look inside the "src" folder.

If you run into problems, please let me know!
